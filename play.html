  <h1>Venkateswara Rao Gadde Presents</h1>
<h3>Taming of the ShrewCoriolanus</h3>
<h5>SCENE I. Before an alehouse on a heath.</h5>
 
<p class="stateDire">Enter Hostess and SLY</p>
<h3 class="stageChar sly">SLY</h3>
<p class="stageSpeech">I'll pheeze you, in faith.</p>
<h3 class="stageChar hostess">Hostess</h3>
<p class="stageSpeech">A pair of stocks, you rogue!</p>
<h3 class="stageChar sly">SLY</h3>
<p class="stageSpeech">Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in
  the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.
  Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!</p>
<h3 class="stageChar hostess">Hostess</h3>
<p class="stageSpeech">You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?</p>
<h3 class="stageChar sly">SLY</h3>
<p class="stageSpeech">No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold
  bed, and warm thee.</p>
<h3 class="stageChar hostess">Hostess</h3>
<p class="stageSpeech">I know my remedy; I must go fetch the
  third--borough.</p>
<p class="stateDire">Exit</p>

<h3 class="stageChar sly">SLY</h3>
<p class="stageSpeech">Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him
  by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,
  and kindly.
  <p class="stateDire">Falls asleep</p>
  
  <p class="stateDire">Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train</p>
  
  <h3 class="stageChar lord">Lord</h3>
 <p class="stageSpeech">Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:
  Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;
  And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.
  Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
  At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
  I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
  First Huntsman
  Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
  He cried upon it at the merest loss
  And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:
  Trust me, I take him for the better dog.</p>
